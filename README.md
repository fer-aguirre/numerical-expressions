# Numerical Expressions
This script calculates and describes the change between two numerical values in various ways. It takes two arguments: an initial value and a final value for comparison.

Created by: Fer Aguirre

TO DO:
- Rate of Change Over Time: Adding a function to describe the rate of change over time. This could be useful for time-series data. For example, calculate the average annual or monthly change.

- Standard Deviations: Adding a function to describe the change in terms of standard deviations. This could be useful for statistical analysis. For example, calculate the z-score of the change.

- Reference Value: Adding a function to describe the change in terms of a reference.
